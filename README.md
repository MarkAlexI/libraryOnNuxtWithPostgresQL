# libraryOnNuxtWithPostgresQL

This is not a library in the strict sense of the word - a repository of books. This is a card index - a set of cards with information.

This project happened spontaneously, I decided to test my abilities, combine what I had already mastered and play with PostgreSQL. Used Nuxt, Tailwind, VueUse and PostgreSQL. Won, it works.
